This repository contains sanctioned individuals and entities from Turkey's
asset freezing lists, maintained by the Ministry of Treasury and Finance.

== Legal Basis

Turkey maintains four sanctions lists under:

* **List B** - Article 6, Law No. 6415: Foreign country requests
* **List C** - Article 7, Law No. 6415: Domestic freezing decisions
* **List D** - Law No. 7262, Articles 3.A/3.B: WMD proliferation prevention

== Knowledge Graph Integration

This repository's processed YAML data feeds into the Ammitto knowledge graph.

When the harmonization process runs:

[source,shell]
----
# Auto-detect all data-* repos and harmonize
ammitto harmonize --scan --sources-dir /path/to/repos --output-dir ./api/v1
----

The tr data is transformed into:

* Individual JSON-LD nodes in `api/v1/node/entity/tr/{id}.jsonld`
* Sanction entries in `api/v1/node/entry/tr/{id}.jsonld`
* Lightweight search index entries
* Facet counts for filtering

== Usage

This data is part of the https://github.com/ammitto/ammitto[Ammitto] sanctions
screening system.
